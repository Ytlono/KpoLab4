Autumn arrived unexpectedly, and with each day, the air became cooler, cooler, and even cooler. In the mornings, the streets were shrouded in thick fog, fog so dense that it hid houses, hid trees, hid everything around. People began to pull out warm scarves, warm jackets, warm hats, trying to keep warm in this cold, a cold that grew stronger with each passing day. Autumn came unexpectedly, unexpectedly and swiftly, taking over everything around. Why does autumn always come so quickly, why?
In the parks, few passersby walked, very few passersby, who wrapped themselves tightly in their warm coats. The playgrounds were empty, the swings swayed in the gusts of wind, and the wind continued to play with the fallen leaves. The leaves fell, fell slowly, but steadily, covering the ground, covering the sidewalks, and the wind carried these leaves, carried them farther and farther away. Everything became quieter, quieter, and quieter. Autumn brought with it silence, a silence that seemed endless.
